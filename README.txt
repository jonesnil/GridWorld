Welcome to the Sheep (Rabbit) AI simulation, Gridworld!

In the new Dijkstra update, you can watch one sheep wander
normally, or you can click a tile to watch him follow a calculated
path to where you clicked. 

Just remember, the sheep don't like to get their feet cold, so they
will never walk on ice. 

They are also of the opinion that sand is coarse and rough and 
irritating and gets everywhere, so they would rather walk 4 or 
so dirt tiles than step foot on some sand. 

In case it comes up, I'm aware of a bug that causes an extra sheep to 
spawn on the edge of the screen and not move. I'm not sure how to fix
it yet, but it shouldn't affect the AI at all and won't move. I think
it has more to do with how I'm setting the tile graphics than the AI. 

Also I'm sorry this isn't in the proper Unity version. I tried to 
downgrade but it completely broke my project and I didn't know how 
to fix it so I reverted to the original version.
